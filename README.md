## Introduction

Skin diseases, particularly melanoma, often require specialized dermatology expertise, which may not be accessible in all regions. HealthBot+ addresses this issue by providing a platform that utilizes advanced AI models to detect:
- Melanoma
- Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma (akiec)
- Basal cell carcinoma (bcc)
- Benign keratosis-like lesions (bkl)
- Dermatofibroma (df)
- Melanocytic nevi (nv)
- Vascular lesions (vasc)

This application integrates state-of-the-art machine learning and natural language processing for early detection and management, empowering users with reliable and accessible diagnostic tools.

## AI Models

### 1. **Fine-Tuned Xception Model for Melanoma Detection**
   - Based on the Xception architecture using depthwise separable convolutions for efficient, high-dimensional feature extraction.
   - Combines image data resized to 300x300 pixels with metadata (age, gender, anatomical site) for robust predictions.

### 2. **Custom CNN for Other Skin Conditions**
   - Detects six skin conditions, including basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratoses, and vascular lesions.
   - Architecture: Four convolutional blocks with pooling layers, followed by dense layers for feature refinement.
